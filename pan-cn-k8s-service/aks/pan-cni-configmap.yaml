data:
  # The CNI network configuration to add to the plugin chain on each node.  The special
  # values in this config will be automatically populated.
  # Some sample options other than the default (follow them by ',' where applicable).
  #        "appinfo_dir": directory on the node where pan-cni can save application
  #                       pod info and some logs. Needs to be same as pan-cni.yaml and
  #                       pan-cn-ngfw.yaml.
  #        "firewall": list of firewalls pan-cni is supporting. Firewall
  #                    annotation's <value> 
  #                      paloaltonetworks.com/firewall: <value>
  #                    in pan-cn-ngfw.yaml and application pod's yaml (or 
  #                    namespace) should be listed here.
  #                    It needs more than one value only when multiple pan-cn-ngfw
  #                    DaemonSet pods to be run on a node (not a common scenario).
  #        "mode": "daemonset" - normal operation mode
  #                "teardown" - run in tearing down mode. As pan-cn-ngfw pod exits
  #                             or starts, it will cleanup all info.
  #                 "service" - run in CN-Series V2, FW as a service in K8S environment
  #        "dpservicename":  This is need if mode is "service". It is the name of the DP
  #                          service deployed.
  #        "dpservicenamespace": - This is need if mode is "service". It is the namespace of the DP
  #                          service deployed.
  #        "passiprange": List of ip ranges which dont need to go to the DP firewall pod
  #                        e.g "passiprange": "10.52.0.0/14,10.56.0.0/20" 
  #        "maxpod_failover": "failopen" - when max pods are being served, bypass
  #                                        firewall for the new pods. Defaults to
  #                                        wait/block on free spot.
  #        "override_mtu": Override the mtu used in the application pod. Defaults to auto mtu detection.
  #        "kubernetes": {
  #           "security_namespaces": All possible namespaces where pan-cn-ngfw
  #                    DaemonSets can be deployed (not application pod's namespace).
  #                    e.g. "security_namespaces": [ "kube-system", "pan-system"]
  #           "exclude_namespaces": Don't secure the listed namespaces (ignores
  #                    application pod's annotation in that namespace).
  #        }
